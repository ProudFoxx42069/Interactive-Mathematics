    <h3>Probability</h3>
    
    <p>Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of random events or phenomena. It is concerned with the measurement of the likelihood of events occurring and is used to make predictions in situations where there is uncertainty. Probability is often used in fields such as finance, engineering, and science to make decisions based on data and the likelihood of certain outcomes.</p>
    
    <h3>Statistics</h3>
    
    <p>Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. It is used to gain insights into data and to make informed decisions based on that data. Statistics is used in a wide variety of fields such as economics, healthcare, and social sciences to analyze data and draw conclusions from it.<br><br>
    
Probability and statistics are closely related, as probability provides the foundation for statistical inference. Statistical inference is the process of making predictions or drawing conclusions about a population based on data collected from a sample of that population.<br><br>

Together, probability and statistics are used to model and understand complex systems, make predictions, and make informed decisions based on data. They are essential tools for researchers, scientists, and decision-makers across a wide range of fields.</p>
