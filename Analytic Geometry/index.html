    <h3>What is Analytic Geometry?</h3>
    
    <p>
      Analytic Geometry, also called coordinate geometry, mathematical subject in which algebraic symbolism and methods are used to represent and solve problems in geometry. The importance of analytic geometry is that it establishes a correspondence between geometric curves and algebraic equations. This correspondence makes it possible to reformulate problems in geometry as equivalent problems in algebra, and vice versa; the methods of either subject can then be used to solve problems in the other. For example, computers create animations for display in games and films by manipulating algebraic equations.
    </p>
    
    <p>Coordinate geometry has its use in both two dimensional and three-dimensional geometry. It is used to represent geometrical shapes. Let us learn the terminologies used in analytic geometry, such as;</p>
    
    <ul>
  <li>Planes</li>
  <li>Coordinates</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Planes</h3>
    
    <p>To understand how analytic geometry is important and useful, First, We need to learn what a plane is? If a flat surface goes on infinitely in both the directions, it is called a Plane. So, if you find any point on this plane, it is easy to locate it using Analytic Geometry. You just need to know the coordinates of the point in X and Y plane.</p>
    
    <h3>Coordinates</h3>
    
    <p>Coordinates are the two ordered pair, which defines the location of any given point in a plane.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">

</div>

    <p>In the above grid, The columns are labelled as A, B, C, and the rows are labelled as 1, 2, 3.</p>
    
    <p>The location of letter x is B2 i.e. Column B and row 2. So, B and 2 are the coordinates of this box, x.</p>
    
    <p>As there are several boxes in every column and rows, but only one box has the point x, and we can find its location by locating the intersection of row and column of that box. There are different types of coordinates in analytical geometry. Some of them are as follows:</p>
    
    <ul>
  <li>Cartesian Coordinates</li>
  <li>Polar Coordinates</li>
  <li>Cylindrical Coordinates</li>
  <li>Spherical Coordinates</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Let us discuss all these types of coordinates are here in brief.</p>
    
    <h3>Cartesian Coordinates</h3>
    
    <p>The most well-known coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate to use, where every point has an x-coordinate and y-coordinate expressing its horizontal position, and vertical position respectively. They are usually addressed as an ordered pair and denoted as (x, y). We can also use this system for three-dimensional geometry, where every point is represented by an ordered triple of coordinates (x, y, z) in Euclidean space.</p>
    
    <h3>Polar Coordinates</h3>
    
    <p>In the case of polar coordinates, each point in a plane is denoted by the distance ‘r’ from the origin and the angle θ from the polar axis.</p>
    
    <h3>Cylindrical Coordinates</h3>
    
    <p>In the case of cylindrical coordinates, all the points are represented by their height, radius from z-axis and the angle projected on the xy-plane with respect to the horizontal axis. The height, radius and the angle are denoted by h, r and θ, respectively.</p>
    
    <h3>Spherical Coordinates</h3>
    
    <p>In spherical coordinates, the point in space is denoted by its distance from the origin ( ρ), the angle projected on the xy-plane with respect to the horizontal axis (θ), and another angle with respect to the z-axis (φ).</p>
    
    <h3>Cartesian Plane</h3>
    
    <p>In coordinate geometry, every point is said to be located on the coordinate plane or cartesian plane only.</p>
    
    <p>Look at the figure below.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">
  <img src="../img/ag.png" alt="Image">
</div>

    <p>The above graph has x-axis and y-axis as it’s Scale. The x-axis is running across the plane and Y-axis is running at the right angle to the x-axis. It is similar to the box explained above.</p>
    
    <p>Let’s learn more about Co-ordinates:</p>
    
    <p>Origin: It is the point of intersection of the axis(x-axis and y-axis). Both x and y-axis are zero at this point.</p>
    
    <p>Values of the different sides of the axis:</p>
    
    <p>x-axis – The values at the right-hand side of this axis are positive and those on the left-hand side are negative.</p>
    
    <p>y-axis – The values above the origin are positive and below the origin are negative.</p>
    
    <p>To locate a point: We need two numbers to locate a plane in the order of writing the location of X-axis first and Y-axis next. Both will tell the single and unique position on the plane. You need to compulsorily follow the order of the points on the plane i.e., the x coordinate is always the first one from the pair. (x, y).</p>
    
    <p>If you look at the figure above, point A has a value 3 on the x-axis and value 2 on the Y-axis. These are the rectangular coordinates of Point A represented as (3, 2).</p>
    
    <p>Using the Cartesian coordinates, we can define the equation of a straight lines, equation of planes, squares and most frequently in the three dimensional geometry. The main function of the analytic geometry is that it defines and represents the various geometrical shapes in the numerical way. It also extracts the numerical information from the shapes.</p>
    
    <h3>Analytic Geometry Formulas</h3>
    
    <p>Graphs and coordinates are used to find measurements of geometric figures. There are many important formulas in analytic Geometry. Since science and engineering involves the study of rate of change in varying quantities, it helps to show the relation between the quantities involved. The branch of Mathematics called “calculus” requires the clear understanding of the analytic geometry. Here, some of the important ones are being used to find the distance, slope or to find the equation of the line.</p>
    
    <h3>Distance Formula</h3>
    
    <p>Let the two points be A and B, having coordinates to be (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) respectively.
    
    <br><br>

Thus, the distance between two points is given as-

    <br><br>

d = √[(x2-x1)2+(y2-y1)2]</p>

    <h3>Midpoint Theorem Formula</h3>
    
    <p>Let A and B are some points in a plane, which is joined to form a line, having coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), respectively. Suppose, M(x, y) is the midpoint of the line connecting the point A and B then its formula is given by; 
    
    <br><br>
    
    M(x, y) = [(x1+x2)/2, (y1+y2)/2)]</p>
    
    <h3>Angle Formula</h3>
    
    <p>Let two lines have slope m1 and m2 and θ is the angle formed between the two lines A and B, which is represented as;

<br><br>

tan θ = (m1-m2)/ (1+m1m2)</p>

    <h3>Section Formula</h3>

    <p>Let two lines A and B have coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), respectively. A point P the two lines in the ratio of m:n, then the coordinates of P is given by;</p>

    <h3>Analytic Geometry in Three Dimensions</h3>
    
    <p>In this, we consider triples (a, b, c) which are real numbers and call this set as three- dimensional number space and denote it by R’. All the elements in the triple are called coordinates.
    
    <br><br>

Let’s see how three-dimensional number space is represented on a geometric space.

    <br><br>

In three-dimensional space, we consider three mutually perpendicular lines intersecting in a point O. these lines are designated coordinate axes, starting from 0, and identical number scales are set up on each of them.</p>

    <h3>Analytic Geometry Applications</h3>
    
    <p>Analytic geometry is widely used in the fields such as Engineering and Physics. Also, it is widely used in the fields such as space science, rocket science, aviation, space flights and so on. Analytical geometry has made many things possible like the following:</p>
    
    <ul>
  <li>We can find whether the given lines are perpendicular or parallel.</li>
  <li>We can determine the mid-point, equation, and slope of the line segment.</li>
  <li>We can find the distance between the points.</li>
  <li>We can also determine the perimeter of the area of the polygon formed by the points on the plane.</li>
  <li>Define the equations of ellipse, curves, and circles.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Analytic Geometry Problems</h3>
    
    <p>Example 1:<br><br>

What is the point of intersection of the axis (X-axis and Y-axis) called?<br><br>

Solution:<br><br>

The point of intersection of the axis (X-axis and Y-axis) called Origin and X and the Y-axis is 0 at this point.<br><br>

Example 2:<br><br>

Find the distance between two points A and B such that the coordinates of A and B are (5, -3) and (2, 1).<br><br>

Solution:<br><br>

Given that, the coordinates are:<br><br>

A = (5, -3)  = (x1, y1)<br><br>

B = (2, 1) = (x2, y2)<br><br>

The formula to find the distance between two points is given as:<br><br>

Distance, d = √[(x2– x1)2 + (y2– y1)2]<br><br>

d = √[(2 – 5)2 + (1- (-3))2]<br><br>

d = √[(-3)2 + (4)2]<br><br>

d = √[9 + 16]<br><br>

d = √(25)<br><br>

d = 5<br><br>

Thus, the distance between two points A and B is 5 units.<br><br>

Example 3:<br><br>

Determine the slope of the line, that passes through the point A(5, -3), and it meets y-axis at 7.<br><br>

Solution:<br><br>

Given that, the point is A = (5, -3)<br><br>

We know that, if the line intercepts at y-axis, then x2 = 0<br><br>

Thus, (x2, y2) = (0, 7)<br><br>

The formula to find the slope of a line is:<br><br>

m = (y2 –y1)/ (x2 -x1)<br><br>

Now, substitute the values<br><br>

m = (7- (-3))/(0 – 5)<br><br>

m = 10/-5<br><br>

m = -2<br><br>

Therefore, the slope of the line is -2.</p>
