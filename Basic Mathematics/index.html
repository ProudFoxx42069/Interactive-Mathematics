    <h3>Basic Mathematics</h3>
    
    <p>Basic Mathematics is a fundamental area of mathematics that includes arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and statistics. It is the foundation upon which more advanced math is built, and is essential for everyday life, as well as many professions such as engineering, finance, and science.</p>

    <h3>Arithmetic</h3>
    
    <p>Arithmetic includes the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also includes the use of fractions, decimals, and percentages.</p>
    
    <h3>Algebra</h3>
    
    <p>Algebra deals with the manipulation and use of symbols and equations to solve problems. It includes topics such as solving linear and quadratic equations, graphing linear and quadratic functions, and working with systems of equations.</p>
    
    <h3>Geometry</h3>
    
    <p>Geometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of shapes, sizes, and positions of objects in space. It includes topics such as points, lines, angles, and planes, as well as the study of circles, polygons, and solids.</p>
    
    <h3>Statistics</h3>
    
    <p>Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. It includes topics such as descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation), probability, and inferential statistics (hypothesis testing, regression analysis).</p>
    
    <p>Having a solid foundation in Basic Mathematics is crucial for success in higher-level math courses, as well as in everyday life situations such as calculating a budget or determining the best deals while shopping.</p>
